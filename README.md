# Fresh cherries
### Fresh Cherries is a platform for sharing information about women's sanitary products.
It is like a sanitary product version of rotten tomatoes.
You can see the overall information, chemical component information, and other user's review. Isn't it weird that even though we live in internet era,
women's menstrual experience is not widespread well.
And people think it is shame to talk.
To break such taboo, we decided to make this service.

#### It's a courese project for SI539 complex web design. View the demo [here](https://fresh-cherries.appspot.com) 



### We used [angular-seed â€” the seed for AngularJS apps](https://github.com/fredsa/appengine-angular-seed-python) for Google App Engine
