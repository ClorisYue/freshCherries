Also, the print on it rubs off. Not only am I already uncomfortable and disgruntled because I've been wrestling with the package and not I've got blue fingers after it too. "

    "content": "As someone with a light flow basis, I really enjoy these pads. They are my go to for when my period is relatively light, where perhaps a regular, full pad isn't needed, but it is too frequent for a liner, that's when Always Ultra Thin Slender saves the day! It's light and simple but still durable for a light flow day. I use these quite often, they are thin comfortable and a pleasing pink color. They are noticeably smaller than Always Ultra Thin Regular but are as marketed, which is why I think they work well for light flow days. Would recommend to my friends. Thank you. "
